-34	You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
-35	You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
-35	sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
-35      white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
-35	Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
-35	someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
-35      25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
-35	shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
-36	You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the
-36	west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.
-37	You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads
-37	west.
-38	You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
-38      enters and exits through tiny slits.

-62      You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.
-63	Dead end
-64	You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
-64	north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
-64	going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
-65      You are in Bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
-65	To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
-66      You are in a room whose walls resemble Swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
-66      go west, east, NE, and NW.  Part of the room is occupied by a large
-66	bedrock block.
-67      You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is
-67	littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
-67	There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east
-67	and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
-67	wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
-68	You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
-68      fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  East and west there once were
-68	large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
-68	passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
-68	around the boulders.
-69      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.
-70      You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
-71	You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
-71      north, south, and SE.  The north one is as tall as the other two
-71	combined.
-72      You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, SE, and SW.
-73	Dead end crawl.
-74	You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses over a
-74	very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
-74	to get back up.
-75      You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.
-76	The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
-77      You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
-77	seems to open up.
-78	The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
-79	The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
-79	It would be advisable to use the exit.

-88	You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
-88	west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
-88	profusion of leaves.
-89	There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave the pit.
-90	You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
-91	You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
-91	climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a
-91	passage leading back to the north.
-92      You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
-92	lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On
-92      the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "Fee fie foe foo" [sic].
-93	The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
-94	You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
-95	You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
-95	over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
-95	through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
-96      You are in the Soft Room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
-96	the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.
-97      This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
-97	walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
-97      passage leads SE, and a hands and knees crawl leads west.
-98	You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
-98	Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
-98	heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path
-98	exits to the south and west.
-99      You are in an alcove.  A small NW path seems to widen after a short
-99	distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
-99	tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
-100	You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely
-100	narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor leads NE.
-101     You're in the Dark-Room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
-102	You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
-102	from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.
-103	You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and
-103     walls are littered with bits of shells embedded in the stone.  A
-103	shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads
-103	up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.
-104	You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
-105	You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
-106	You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small
-106	passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident.
-106	A sign in midair here says "Cave under construction beyond this point.
-106	Proceed at own risk.  [Witt construction company]"
-107	You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
-108     You are at Witt's End.  Passages lead off in *all* directions.
-109	You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
-109	covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
-109	upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
-109	above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
-109     midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
-109	for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
-109     small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
-110	You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
-110	sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
-110	white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
-110	Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
-110	someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
-110     25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
-110	shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
-111	A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor
-111	below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but
-111	having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
-112	You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
-113	You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
-113	of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
-113	fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
-113	overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
-113     mist.  The only passage goes back toward the south.
-114	Dead end
-115	You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
-115     Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure"
-115	program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
-115	yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
-115	of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
-115	of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
-115	a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
-115	are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads: "Do
-115	not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
-115	wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
-115	sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
-116     You are at the southwest end of the Repository.  To one side is a pit
-116	full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
-116	wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
-116	corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
-116	large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A
-116	vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large
-116     steel grate, next to which is a sign which reads, "Treasure Vault.
-116     Keys in Main Office."
-117	You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
-117     up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A SW path leads away
-117	from the chasm into a winding corridor.
-118	You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
-118	directions.
-119	You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
-120	You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
-121	You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
-122	You are on the far side of the chasm.  A NE path leads away from the
-122	chasm on this side.
-123	You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be
-123	heard in the distance.
-124	The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
-124	seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
-124	down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.
-125	The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
-125	roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
-125	passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
-126	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
-126	active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
-126	out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
-126	farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
-126	thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
-126	sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
-126	the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
-126	sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
-126	formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
-126	light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
-126	gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
-126	have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
-126	crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
-126	gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
-126	the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
-126	from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
-126	ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
-126	own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
-126	hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
-127	You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are
-127	very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
-127	heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
-127	a low rumbling.
-128	You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with
-128	oddly shaped limestone formations.
-129	You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A sign
-129	posted above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"
-130	You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
-130	empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
-130	far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.

+126	息をのむような眺めの場所の端にいる。遥か下には活動中の火山がから大量
+126	の溶岩が吹きだし、深いところに流れている。遠くにある洞窟の壁の焼けた
+126	岩は血のような赤色に輝いていて、全てが恐ろしく不気味に見える。あたり
+126	は火の粉が舞い、硫黄のにおいで満ちている。壁は触れないほど熱く、火山
+126	は他の音が聞こえないほど大きな音をたてている。頭上には無数の雪形石膏
+126	のつららがあり、それらは陰気な光を放ち壁を邪悪な雰囲気で照らしている。
+126	別の方向には深い谷があり、そこには悪魔によって作られたかのような奇妙
+126	にねじれた岩が無数にある。巨大な溶岩の川が火山の奥底から峡谷を通り、
+126	あなたの左側にある底なしの穴に流れている。右には熱湯の間欠泉があり、
+126	それは無気味に泡立つ硫黄の池の中央にある島から噴き出ている。右遠方の

-1       Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in

+1	単語で命令できる。注意すべきことは、最初の5文字しか識別しないことで
+1	あり、例えば北東のつもりで "northeast" と入力した場合でも "north" と
+1	解釈される。[ 訳者注:日本語の場合は文字数の制限はない。]

-1       This program was originally developed by Will Crowther.  Most of the
-1       features of the current program were added by Don Woods.  Address
-1       complaints about the UNIX version to Jim Gillogly (jim@rand.org).
-2	A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
-3	A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
-3       axe at you (which missed), cursed, and ran away.
-4	There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
-5	One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
-6	None of them hit you!
-7	One of them gets you!
-8       A hollow voice says "Plugh".
-9	There is no way to go that direction.
-10	I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
-11	I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
-11	in the general direction you want to go.
-12	I don't know how to apply that word here.
-13	I don't understand that!
-14	I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
-15	Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the
-15	long description of your location.
-16	It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
-17	If you prefer, simply type w rather than west.
-18	Are you trying to catch the bird?
-19	The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no matter
-19	what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
-20	Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
-21	You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
-21	like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
-21	resources right now.
-22	Do you really want to quit now?
-23	You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
-24	You are already carrying it!
-25	You can't be serious!
-26	The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
-26	disturbed and you cannot catch it.
-27	You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
-28	There is nothing here with a lock!
-29	You aren't carrying it!
-30	The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
-30	drives the snake away.
-31	You have no keys!
-32	It has no lock.
-33	I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
-34	It was already locked.
-35	The grate is now locked.
-36	The grate is now unlocked.
-37	It was already unlocked.
-38	You have no source of light.
-39	Your lamp is now on.
-40	Your lamp is now off.
-41	There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
-41	probably just as well.
-42	Nothing happens.
-43	Where?
-44	There is nothing here to attack.
-45	The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
-46	Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
-47	You killed a little dwarf.
-48	You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
-49	With what?  Your bare hands?
-50	Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
-51	I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
-51	describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
-51	like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
-51	up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
-51	hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
-51	the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
-51	object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
-51	the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
-51	particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
-51	give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side
-51	effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
-51	trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
-51	trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
-51	beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
-51	different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
-51	distances with a single word.  For example, "building" usually gets
-51	you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
-51	forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
-51	room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
-51	Good luck!
-52	It misses!
-53	It gets you!
+1	このプログラムのオリジナルはウイリアム・クラウザーによって開発された。

+2	大きなナイフを持った小さなドワーフが道をふさいでいる。
+3	小さなドワーフが道のかどから現れ、あなたを見ると小さな斧を投げつけた。
+3	斧ははずれ、ドワーフはあなたを罵り逃げた。
+4	あなたに驚いている小さなドワーフがいる!
+5	鋭いナイフをあなたに投げつけた!
+6	それらは全て外れた!
+7	それらのうちの1つがあなたに命中した!
+8	かすかに『 Plugh 』という声が聞こえた。
+9	その方向には行けない。
+10	あなたがどちらの方向を向いているかはわからない。方角か近くのものの名
+10	前を使うこと。
+11	ここでは「入る(in)」、「出る(out)」ではわからない。方角かあなたの行き
+11	たい方向にあるものの名前を使うこと。
+12	その単語をどうすればよいかわからない。
+13	わからない!
+14	私はゲームである。もっとわかりやすく説明して欲しい。
+15	残念ながらこれ以上詳しく説明することはできない。もう一度長い文章をく
+15	りかえす。
+16	ここはとても暗い。このまま進むと穴に落ちてしまいそうだ。
+17	westをwと省略することもできる。
+18	小鳥を捕まえようとしているのか?
+19	小鳥は怯えていて、どのようにしても捕まえることができない。後でもう一
+19	度試したほうが良いかもしれない。
+20	ヘビを何とかしようとしているのか?
+21	ヘビを殺す、追い払う、避けるなどのことはできない。何とか通るべき道だ
+21	が、あなたはそれをするためのものを現在持っていない。
+22	本当に終了してよいか?
+23	穴に落ち、全身の骨が折れた!
+24	すでに持っている!
+25	ご冗談を!
+26	小鳥はあなたが入ってきたとき怯えていなかった。しかし、あなたが近づく
+26	と小鳥は暴れだし、捕らえることができなかった。
+27	小鳥を捕まえたが、運ぶことができない。
+28	開けられるものがない!
+29	それを持っていない!
+30	小鳥が緑色のヘビを攻撃すると、ヘビは驚き追い払われた。
+31	鍵を持っていない!
+32	それには錠がない。
+33	それで錠の開閉はできない。
+34	既に閉じている。
+35	鉄格子は閉じた。
+36	鉄格子は開いた。
+37	既に開いている。
+38	光源がない。
+39	明かりがついた。
+40	明かりが消えた。
+41	鎖を外すために熊の前を通り過ぎるのは無理だ。そのようなことはしないほ
+41	うがよい。
+42	何も起こらない。
+43	どこに?
+44	攻撃するものは何もない。
+45	小鳥は死んだ。死体は見えなくなった。
+46	ヘビを攻撃するのは危険で無意味だ。
+47	小さなドワーフを倒した。
+48	ドワーフを攻撃したが、巧みにかわされた。
+49	どうやって? 素手で?
+50	良い方法だ。しかしそれは古く、もはや効果のない魔法だ。
+51	私は場所、行動、物体のことを知っている。私の知っている単語の多くは、
+51	あなたのいる場所の状況を表すためや、移動のためものである。移動には、
+51	森(forest)、建物(building)、下流(downstream)、入る(enter)、東(east)、
+51	西(west)、北(north)、南(south)、上(up)、そして下(down)のような単語を
+51	用いることができる。
+51	また、いくつかの特別な物、例えば洞窟に隠された黒い杖などを私は知って
+51	いる。これらはいくつかの動詞で扱うことができる。通常、動詞と物の2つを
+51	入力する必要があるが、動詞だけで物が類推されることもある。また、いく
+51	つかの物は動詞が類推される。特に、"inventory"は "take inventory" を示
+51	す。これはあなたが今何を持っているかを表示する。[ 訳者注:日本語の場合
+51	は「持ち物」。] 物には副作用があることがある。例えば、杖は小鳥を脅え
+51	させる。
+51	通常、冒険者たちは移動に困り、2、3の単語を試さなければならない。通常、
+51	冒険者たちは物の使い方について無駄な努力をし、物(と私!)の能力の限界に
+51	挑戦し、徹底的に様々なことを試さなければならない。
+51	すばやくゲームを進めるために、あなたは遠くから1つの単語で移動できる。
+51	例えば、「建物(building)」は森で迷っていない限り地上のどこからでも小
+51	屋に移動することができる。また、洞窟には曲がりくねっていて、あなたが
+51	北から部屋を出ても、次の部屋に南から入るとは限らない。
+51	幸運を!
+52	それは外れた!
+53	それはあなたに命中した!
 54	OK
-55	You can't unlock the keys.
-56	You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
-56	main passage.
-57	I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
-57	the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
-58	I need more detailed instructions to do that.
-59	I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
-59	things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
-60	I don't know that word.
-61	What?
-62	Are you trying to get into the cave?
-63	The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
-63	enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
-63	looking elsewhere for the keys.
-64	The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
-64	occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
-64	growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
-64	various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
-64	all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
-64	spruce and berry bushes.
-65      Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?
-66	Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
-66	progress is unlikely.
-67	Blasting requires dynamite.
-68	I'm as confused as you are.
-69	Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
-69	caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
-69	pit leading down to water.
-70	Your feet are now wet.
-71	I think I just lost my appetite.
-72	Thank you, it was delicious!
-73	You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of
-73	minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
-74	The bottle of water is now empty.
-75	Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
-75	nothing exciting happens.
-76	Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
-77	Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
-78	You can't pour that.
-79	Watch it!
-80	Which way?
-81	Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
-81      help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
-81	to try to reincarnate you?
-82	All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
-82	                    --- Poof!! ---
-82	You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,
-82	you emerge from the smoke and find....
-83	You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can
-83	keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
-84	Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >poof!<
-84	Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
-85	Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
-85	me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
-86	Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!
+55	鍵の錠を外すことはできない。
+56	いくつかの小さな穴をはいまわり、元の通路に戻ってきた。
+57	洞窟がどこにあるかわからない。しかし、このあたりに長い川はない。川下
+57	に行ってみるべきだ。
+58	それをするもっと詳しい情報が必要だ。
+59	あなたの見えるものや、扱うことのできるもののみ伝えられる。遠くにある
+59	ものは伝えられない。
+60	その単語はわからない。
+61	何だって?
+62	洞窟に入ろうとしているのか?
+63	鉄格子はとても固く、頑丈な鋼鉄の錠がある。鍵なしで入ることはできず、
+63	また近くに鍵はなさそうだ。どこか別の場所で鍵を探したほうがよいだろう。
+64	この森の木は大きなカシとカエデであり、所々に松やエゾマツがある。まば
+64	らに成長中のカバやトネリコの若木があり、地面には様々な種類の草が生え
+64	ている。この時期、生い茂る木の葉によって視界はとても悪いが、エゾマツ
+64	とベリーのあたりを回り道すれば簡単に移動できる。
+65	『アドベンチャー』へようこそ!! 説明が必要ですか?
+66	シャベルなしで穴を掘るのは現実的ではない。さらにシャベルで穴を掘って
+66	進むことも不可能だ。
+67	爆破するにはダイナマイトが必要だ。
+68	私もあなたと同じくらい混乱している。
+69	白い霧は小さな水の粒であり、洞窟内で時々見られる。それはしばしば穴の
+69	深いところに水があることを示している。
+70	あなたの足は濡れた。
+71	私なら食欲がわかない。
+72	どうも。これはうまい!
+73	小川の水を飲んだ。水はミネラルが多いようだったが、とても冷たく、まず
+73	くはなかった。
+74	ビンの水は空になった。
+75	電灯をこすることはまったく無意味である。やはり何も起こらなかった。
+76	おもしろい。そうするとは思わなかった。
+77	ビンの水はこぼれ空になった。
+78	それを注ぐことはできない。
+79	注意!
+80	どちらへ?
+81	ああ、あなたは死んでしまったようだ。私はあなたを手伝うことができたか
+81	もしれないが、今となっては後の祭りだ。私にあなたを生き返らせることを
+81	望むか?
+82	よろしい。でも、どうなっても私に文句を言わないように…
+82	                    --- プシュー!! ---
+82	あなたはオレンジ色の煙に包まれた。激しい咳で苦しみながら、あなたは煙
+82	の中からあらわれた。すると…
+83	愚かなことにあなたは同じ過ちを繰り返した。私にはどれくらい続けられる
+83	かわからないが、再び私にあなたを生き返らせることを望むか?
+84	わかった。オレンジ色の煙をどこに置いたかな?…  >プシュー!<
+84	濃いオレンジ色の煙で何も見えなくなった。
+85	あなたはまたやってしまった! 私のオレンジ色の煙もなくなった! オレンジ
+85	色の煙がなくなった私には、うまく生き返ることは期待できない。そうだろ
+85	う?
+86	うむ、それだけ賢ければ自分でどうにかしなさい。それでは!

-91	Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
-92	You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something first.
-93	You can't go through a locked steel grate!
-94	I believe what you want is right here with you.
-95	You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
-96	I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
-97	There is no way across the fissure.
-98	You're not carrying anything.
-99	You are currently holding the following:
-100	It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
-100	have no bird seed.
-101	The snake has now devoured your bird.
-102	There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
-103	You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *really* mad!!
-104	You have nothing in which to carry it.
-105	Your bottle is already full.
-106	There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
-107	Your bottle is now full of water.
-108	Your bottle is now full of oil.
-109	You can't fill that.
-110	Don't be ridiculous!
-111	The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
-112	The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, "water?"
-113	The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
-114	The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
-114	although it requires some effort.
-115	The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
-116	The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
-117	Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
-117	You'd best take inventory and drop something.
-118	You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
-119	You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!
-120	I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >strain!<
-121	I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >wrench!<
-122	You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
-123	You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
-124	A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
-124	this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
-124	bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
-125	The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
-125	promptly snaps shut again.
-126	You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
-126	blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
-127	There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
-128	Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"
-128	he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
-128	chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
-128	the gloom.
-129	A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
-129     soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through Main Office."
-130	A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
-130        "This exit is closed.  Please leave via Main Office."
-131	It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
-131	closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
-132     The sepulchral voice intones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
-132	fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
-132     smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
-133     There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
-133	wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
-133     and find yourself in the Main Office, where a cheering band of
-133	friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
-134	There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
-134	wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
-134	in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
-135	There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
-135	walls of the room.
-136	The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several
-136	threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
-136	knives at you!  All of them get you!
-137	Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
-138     I dare say whatever you want is around here somewhere.
-139	I don't know the word "stop".  Use "quit" if you want to give up.
-140	You can't get there from here.
-141	You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
-142	If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  To suspend your
-142	adventure such that you can continue later, say "suspend" (or "pause"
-142     or "save").  To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "hours".
-142	To see how well you're doing, say "score".  To get full credit for a
-142	treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get
-142	partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting
-142	killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are
-142	also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
-142	explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
-142	distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are
-142	other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
-142	harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
-142	keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
-142	haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen,
-142	it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
-142     more points in the Master's Section.  I may occasionally offer hints
-142	if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
-142	how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
-142	save paper, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat
-142	the full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.
-143	Do you indeed wish to quit now?
-144	There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
-145	The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
-146	It is beyond your power to do that.
-147	I don't know how.
-148	It is too far up for you to reach.
-149	You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
-149	black smoke.
-150	The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
-151	What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
-152	The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
-153	The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
-154	The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
-154	gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
-155	On what?
-156     Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
-156	you come to it.  To get the full description, say "look".
-157	Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
-157	that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
-158	The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
-158     back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
-159	The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
-160	The troll refuses to let you cross.
-161	There is no longer any way across the chasm.
-162	Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
-162	weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
-162	scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
-162	stumble back and fall into the chasm.
-163	The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
-163	scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
-164	The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.
-165	With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *his* bear hands??
-166	The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
-167	For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
-168	The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm
-168     down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
-169	The bear is still chained to the wall.
-170	The chain is still locked.
-171	The chain is now unlocked.
-172	The chain is now locked.
-173	There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
-174	There is nothing here to eat.
-175	Do you want the hint?
-176	Do you need help getting out of the maze?
-177	You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
-178     Are you trying to explore beyond the Plover Room?
-179	There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
-179	falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately
-179	useful in discovering the secret.
-180	Do you need help getting out of here?
-181	Don't go west.
-182	Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
-183	Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
-183	You can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
-183	machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
-184	Your lamp has run out of power.
-185	There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
-185	explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.
-186	There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
-186	turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
-186	He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've
-186	been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
-186	With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
-187	Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those batteries.
-188	Your lamp is getting dim.  I'm taking the liberty of replacing the
-188	batteries.
-189	Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd
-189	best start wrapping this up.
-190     I'm afraid the magazine is written in Dwarvish.
-191	"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
-192	Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
-192	read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
-193	It says, "there is something strange about this place, such that one
-193     of the words I've always known now has a new effect."
-194	It says the same thing it did before.
-195	I'm afraid I don't understand.
-196     "Congratulations on bringing light into the Dark-Room!"
-197	You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
-197	myriad tiny fragments.
-198	You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
-199	You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
-199	you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
-200	Is this acceptable?
-201	There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
-202     You awaken only to discover your bits have been dissolving while you
-202     slept.  You disappear in a cloud of greasy black smoke.
+91	残念ながら、どうやってたどり着いたかもうわからない。
+92	これ以上持ち運ぶことができない。まず何かをおくこと。
+93	閉じた鉄格子を通ることはできない!
+94	ここがあなたの望む場所だと思う。
+95	5センチの隙間に入ることはできない!
+96	恐れながら、跳び越えるよりも橋を渡ることをすすめる。
+97	地割れを渡る方法はない。
+98	何も持っていない。
+99	次のものを持っている:
+100	小鳥は腹を空かせてはいない。(フィヨルドが恋しいだけだ。)さらに、あな
+100	たは鳥の餌など持っていない。
+101	ヘビは小鳥を飲み込んだ。
+102	ここには食べさせるものは(恐らくあなたを除いて)なにもない。
+103	馬鹿な。ドワーフは石炭しか食べない! 彼は *本当に* 怒った!!
+104	持ち運ぶものは何もない。
+105	ビンは既に満たされている。
+106	ビンを満たすものは何もない。
+107	ビンは水で満たされた。
+108	ビンは油で満たされた。
+109	それで汲むことはできない。
+110	とんでもない!
+111	ドアは完全に錆ついていて、開けることができなかった。
+112	植物は怒り、油を葉から振り落とし尋ねた。「水?」
+113	ちょうつがいは完全に錆びて、少しも動かなくなった。
+114	油はちょうつがいの錆を落とし、扉は動くようになった。何とか開きそうだ。
+115	植物はとても根を深くはっているようで、引き抜くことができなかった。
+116	ドワーフのナイフは洞窟の壁に当たり、どこかへいってしまったようだ。
+117	持ち物のせいでトンネルを通ることができないようだ。持ち物を調べて何か
+117	置いたほうがよい。
+118	1.5メートルのハマグリを持ったままでは狭い通路を通れない!
+119	1.5メートルのカキを持ったままでは狭い通路を通れない!
+120	ハマグリを開く前に置くことをすすめる。>ギュ!<
+121	カキを開く前に置くことをすすめる。>グイ!<
+122	ハマグリを開けられるほど固いものを持っていない。
+123	カキを開けられるほど固いものを持っていない。
+124	輝く真珠がハマグリから落ちて、どこかに転がった。おっと、実際にはカキ
+124	だった。(2枚貝のことはよく知らない。) どちらにせよ、貝はすぐに閉じた。
+125	カキはきしみながら開いたが、中にはカキの身しかなかった。カキはすぐに
+125	元のように閉じた。
+126	小さな穴をはい回ったが、最近の落盤で塞がれていることがわかった。あな
+126	たは元の通路に戻った。
+127	あなたの後ろの暗闇から、何かが向かってくるかすかな音がする。
+128	背後の暗闇から、ヒゲをはやした海賊が飛びかかってきた! 彼は満足げに笑
+128	った。「ハッハッ! いただいた物は迷路の奥の宝箱に隠すとするか! 」
+128	彼はあなたから財宝を奪い取り、闇の中に消え去った。
+129	憂うつな声が洞窟内にこだました。「洞窟はまもなく閉じられます。全ての
+129	冒険者はメインオフィスを通って脱出してください。」
+130	録音された、不可思議な、死に瀕したような声のアナウンスが聞こえた。
+130	「この出口は閉鎖されました。メインオフィスを通って脱出して下さい。」
+131	あなたは死んでいるように見える。ああ、どちらにせよ最期のときが近づい
+131	ている。もう終わりにしよう。
+132	憂うつな声が聞こえた。「洞窟は閉じました。」声はかすかになり、目が見
+132	えなくなるような光があたりを覆った (そしてわずかなオレンジ色の煙も)…
+132	あなたは再び目を開け、あたりを見渡した。すると…
+133	大爆発が起こり、5メートルの大穴が遠くの壁に開き、ドワーフ達が岩の下敷
+133	きになった。穴に入ると、そこはメインオフィスだった。
+133	喝采をあげるエルフの音楽隊が、あなたを勝利者として夕暮れの地上へと導
+133	いた。
+134	大爆発が起こり、5メートルの大穴が遠くの壁に空き、たくさんのヘビが岩の
+134	下敷きになった。溶岩が穴から流れ出し、全てを破壊しながら押し寄せ、つ
+134	いにあなを飲み込んだ!
+135	大爆発が起こり、あなたは突然部屋の向こう側の壁に叩きつけられた。
+136	騒ぎでドワーフ達が目をさました。恐怖に脅えた数人の小さなドワーフがあ
+136	なたの前にいる! 彼らはあなたに向かってナイフを投げつけ、それらは全て
+136	命中した!
+137	ああ、あわれで不幸な小鳥をはなしてやろう。
+138	恐れながら、あなたの欲しい物はこのあたりにある。
+139	"stop"という単語は知らない。あきらめるときは"quit"を使うこと。
+140	ここで取ることはできない。
+141	あなたになついたとても大きな熊が後を追っている。
+142	もし今すぐゲームを終了したいときは「終了(quit)」と入力する。後で続き
+142	を行えるように冒険を中断したいときは「保存(save)」入力すればよい。
+142	「時間(hours)」と入力すると、洞窟が通常何時に開いているかがわかる。
+142	「得点(score)」と入力すると、どのくらいうまく探検を進めているかを表示
+142	する。財宝を手に入れたと認められるには、財宝を安全に小屋に持ちかえら
+142	なければならない。財宝のありかを発見しただけでも功績の一部が認められ
+142	る。得点は殺されたとき、あるいは終了したときに減少する。殺されたとき
+142	の方が大きく減少する。得点は(もしできたなら)あなたがどのくらい洞窟を
+142	探索したも関係する。特に、洞窟に入ることには多くの得点が与えられる
+142	(これが初心者とそうでない者を分ける)。またそれとは別に、どれだけ困難
+142	を体験し乗り越えたかでも得点が決まる。
+142	もしあなたが全ての財宝を見つけたと思ったなら、しばらくの間洞窟の探検
+142	を続けるとよい。もし、何もおこらないならあなたはまだ全ての財宝を手に
+142	入れていない。もし何かが起こったなら、それは多くの得点を得たことを意
+142	味し、更に多くの得点を得られる最後の謎に挑戦する機会を得る。
+142	時々、あなたが困難に直面しているときヒントが与えられることがある。
+142	最後に、紙を節約するためには「短縮(brief)」と入力する。そうすると明示
+142	しない限り長い説明を繰り返さない。
+143	ここで終了するか?
+144	壷を満たすものはここにはない。
+145	急激な温度の変化で繊細な壷は割れた。
+146	それを行うだけの力がない。
+147	なぜそうするのかわからない。
+148	遠すぎてとどかない。
+149	ドワーフを倒した。死体は油だらけの黒い煙の中に消えた。
+150	貝はとても固く傷つけることができなかった。
+151	読めないのか? 早く始めたほうがよい。
+152	斧は竜の厚いうろこを傷つけられずに跳ね返った。
+153	竜はどちらかと言うと危険そうに見える。仲良くしないほうがよさそうだ。
+154	小鳥は緑色の竜を攻撃した。小鳥は驚き追い払われ炎で燃殻になった。灰は
+154	どこかに吹き飛んだ。
+155	どの上に?
+156	ここからは初めて訪れた場所のみ詳細な記述をする。詳細な記述を表示する
+156	ためには「見る(look)」と入力すること。
+157	トロルは岩のように大きく、その皮膚はサイのように固い。トロルはあなた
+157	の攻撃を軽々と払いのけた。
+158	トロルは斧を器用に受け止め、入念に調べ、そしてあなたに投げ返し大声で
+158	言った。「よい品だ。だが、これではだめだ。」
+159	トロルはあなたの投げた財宝を受け取り、走り去った。
+160	トロルはあなたを通そうとしなかった。
+161	もはやこの深い穴を通る方法はない。
+162	橋を渡り終えようとしたとき、あなたについてきた熊の重みで橋が下に向か
+162	って大きく曲がった。あなたは必死でしがみついたが、橋は崩れあなたは大
+162	穴に転落した。
+163	熊がゆっくりとトロルに向かうと、トロルは驚き叫びながら走り去った。熊
+163	は追うことをあきらめ戻ってきた。
+164	斧は外れ、あなたが近づくことのできない熊の近くに落ちた。
+165	どうやって? 素手で? *熊*の素手と??
+166	熊は混乱している。彼はあなたと仲よくしただけだ。
+167	どんなに嘆いても、哀れにもそれは既に死んでいる!
+168	熊は夢中で食料を食べている。食べ終えた後、熊は落ち着き、あなたになつ
+168	いた。
+169	熊は既に鎖で壁につながれている。
+170	既に鍵がかけられている。
+171	鎖の鍵をはずした。
+172	鎖の鍵をかけた。
+173	鎖に鍵をかけるものがない。
+174	食べられる物がない。
+175	ヒントが必要か?
+176	迷路から抜け出すためのヒントが必要か?
+177	どこも同じように見える迷路は物を置くと区別できる。
+178	チドリの部屋に入ろうとしているのか?
+179	くぼみに降りることなく部屋に入る方法がある。その秘密を発見するには持
+179	ち物は有効ではない。
+180	ここから抜け出すためのヒントが必要か?
+181	西に進んではならない。
+182	暴食は数あるトロルの悪徳の1つではない。強欲はそうであるが。
+183	ランタンは暗くなった。新しいバッテリーを見つけるまで、ランタンを消し
+183	たほうがよい。噂では迷路にバッテリーの自動販売機があるらしい。何枚か
+183	のコインをもっていくべきだろう。
+184	ランタンは電気を使いきった。
+185	このあたりをうろつくことには意味がない。そしてランタンなしで洞窟を探
+185	索することはできない。もう終わりにしよう。
+186	背後の暗闇からかすかなガサガサという音が聞こえた。ふりかえると、あな
+186	たのランタンは大きな宝箱を運ぶヒゲをはやした海賊を照らした。彼は叫ん
+186	だ。「おどろかせるな! ようやく場所がわかったぞ! 急いで宝を迷路に隠す
+186	とするか! 」彼は暗がりの中に消えた。
+187	ランタンは暗くなった。バッテリーを換えるために戻ったほうがよい。
+188	ランタンは暗くなった。私は自分のランタンのバッテリーを取り替えている。
+189	ランタンが暗くなってきた。そして、換えのバッテリーもない。ランタンを
+189	消したほうがよいだろう。
+190	残念ながらこの雑誌はドワーフ語で書かれているようだ。
+191	「ここは海賊が宝を隠した迷路ではありません。」
+192	むむ、これは手掛かりのようだ。これを読むためには10点必要だが、それで
+192	も読むか?
+193	「この場所は何か奇妙だ。ある1つの言葉が新しい効果を得たようだ。」
+194	以前と同じことが書かれている。
+195	残念ながらわからない。
+196	『おめでとう! よくぞ暗い部屋に明かりを持ち込んだ! 』
+197	鏡を打つと、鏡は音を立てて崩れ無数の破片になった。
+198	壷を持ち床に投げ付けた。
+199	近くのドワーフを起こした。ドワーフは不満気そう目をさまし、あなたを見
+199	て斧を構えた。
+200	それでよいか?
+201	ゲームを保存できるだけの得点がない。
+202	目をさますと、あなたのメモリが寝ている間に溶けてしまったことがわかっ
+202	た。あなたは油だらけの黒い煙の中に消えた。

-1	A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.  It clears away
-1	to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey.  He fixes you with a steely
-1       glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long."  With that
-1	he makes a single pass over you with his hands, and everything around
-1       you fades away into a grey nothingness.
-2	Even wizards have to wait longer than that!
-3       I'm terribly sorry, but Colossal Cave is closed.  Our hours are:
-4	Only wizards are permitted within the cave right now.
-5	We do allow visitors to make short explorations during our off hours.
-5	Would you like to do that?
-6       Colossal Cave is open to regular adventurers at the following hours:
-7	Very well.
-8	Only a wizard may continue an adventure this soon.
-9	I suggest you resume your adventure at a later time.
-10	Do you wish to see the hours?
-11	Do you wish to change the hours?
-12	New magic word (null to leave unchanged):
-13	New magic number (null to leave unchanged):
-14	Do you wish to change the message of the day?
-15	Okay.  You can save this version now.
-16	Are you a wizard?
-17	Prove it!  Say the magic word!
-18	That is not what I thought it was.  Do you know what I thought it was?
-19	Oh dear, you really *are* a wizard!  Sorry to have bothered you . . .
-20	Foo, you are nothing but a charlatan!
-21	New hours specified by defining "prime time".  Give only the hour
-21	(E.g. 14, not 14:00 or 2pm).  Enter a negative number after last pair.
-22      New hours for Colossal Cave:
-23	Limit lines to 70 chars.  End with null line.
-24	Line too long, retype:
-25	Not enough room for another line.  Ending message here.
-26	Do you wish to (re)schedule the next holiday?
-27	To begin how many days from today?
-28	To last how many days (zero if no holiday)?
-29	To be called what (up to 20 characters)?
-30	Too small!  Assuming minimum value (45 minutes).
-31	Break out of this and save your core-image.
-32	Be sure to save your core-image...

+1	ーブを着た魔法使いによって消された。彼はあなたをにらんで言った。「こ
+1	の探検は長すぎた。」彼があなたの上に手をかざすと、周りのものは全て灰
+1	色の無の中に消えていった。
+2	魔法使いでもこれくらいは待たなければならない!
+3	誠に申し訳ありませんが、コロッサル・ケイブは本日終了しました。営業時間:
+4	魔術師だけが現在洞窟に入ることができる。
+5	時間外は短い探索のみ行うことができる。それでよいか?
+6	コロッサル・ケイブ 営業時間:
+7	よろしい。
+8	魔法使いのみが今すぐ探検を続けることができる。

+18	それは私が考えていた物ではない。私が考えていたものがわかるか?
+19	ああ、本物の魔術師だ! お手数かけました…
+20	ふう、あなたはただのイカサマ師だ!
+21	新しい「ゴールデンタイム」を決める。時間のみ入力すること。
